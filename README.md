# StoryGame

The scope of this project was to become more familiar with Python and it's capabilities in conjunction with tkinter.

I decided to go with a story-based game that could end up with different endings depending on the actions you decided on earlier on the story. I first hand-drew a story board to get a draft of what the story and scenes would be like. After crafting each scene, and having a solid grasp of the different variables I would manipulate to determine the different endings, I started coding.

As I started coding, I realized that my method was quite unsophisticated. I was merely writing if-statements within if-statements x99. Nevertheless, I continued doing so to see how effective Python would be in these scenarios. Python was still very fast (not surprising as they are just loading up the images into tkinter), and it was easy to manipulate my different variables that determined the different endings.

All in all, this was a good learning experience to get exposure to Python, tkinter, and it's initial abilities. For the next time, it would be more interesting to explore a more robust use of Python.
